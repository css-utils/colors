# Colors

A simpler implementation of the [proposed color function](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color/#modifying-colors).
This is basically [rework-color-function](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/rework-color-function) without the [rework](https://github.com/reworkcss/rework) dependency.
Thus, it is faster and has no dependencies.

## Installation

```
npm i css-colors
```

## Usage

```bash
var colors = require('css-colors')

css = colors(css)
```
